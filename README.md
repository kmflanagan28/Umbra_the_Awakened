Umbra the Awakened
ðŸ“– Overview
Umbra is a personalized, command-line AI assistant designed to act as a synergistic partner. It helps gather and analyze information, manage personal data, and automate tasks through a system of specialized agents.

Persistent Memory: Umbra remembers information through a dedicated SQLite database.

External Knowledge: Connects to external APIs (OpenWeather, Tavily) to fetch real-time information.

Travel Database: Manages a personal database of friends and points of interest to assist in planning.

Automated Briefings: Can compose and send daily email briefings.
